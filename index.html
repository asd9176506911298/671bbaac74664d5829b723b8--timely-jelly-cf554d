        Who is Fusang, you ask? Let me tell you this—no one really knows. They hide behind the mask of an "NGO," a title that doesn't fool anyone who's paying attention. You see, this isn’t some kind-hearted charity helping the world. No, this organization was set up for something dark, something secret. No public records of their purpose, no clear timeline of their formation. Yet somehow, they’ve amassed endless resources, mountains of cash, and connections with the elite. They control secrets we can only guess at—secrets they don’t want us to see. Well, here, I’m pulling back the curtain piece by piece. Stay tuned, if you dare.

        The Sun Empire—have you even heard of it? Yeah, they’d prefer you hadn’t. This ancient civilization, spanning continents, might’ve been more advanced than we are now. But you barely hear a whisper about them. Why? Fusang has made sure of it. For decades, maybe even centuries, they’ve been out there, quietly snatching up every relic, every artifact connected to the Sun Empire. When they can’t own it, they destroy it. And just recently, they’ve “allowed” a few pieces to show up in museums—giving us crumbs. But don’t be fooled. It’s a controlled release, to shape the story, to cover something much bigger. A civilization like that vanishing? Impossible. There’s a reason they want it hidden, and I’m here to find it.

        If you think academia is immune to this kind of interference, think again. Fusang has its claws in research teams across the world, buying artifacts, funding projects, bending scholars to their will. A former head of an excavation they sponsored told me how they “supervised” the whole dig. And the finds? Never reached the public. They were “confiscated,” sealed away in Fusang’s private vaults. The ex-archaeologist described it like working for a government’s secret agency—restrictions, clauses in contracts, all to keep them silent. If you believe in honest discovery, wake up. They’re rewriting our past.

        Taiwan, 1990s. A dive team was sent to explore ruins off the coast, a project funded, once again, by Fusang. Thirty people involved. But we never heard a peep about the outcome. And here’s the kicker—the lead archaeologist, Wu Haimin, just disappeared. Fusang doesn’t even acknowledge he existed. Think about that. A man at the head of an entire dig, erased from existence. What happened down there? A cover-up of something they found, a fatal mistake? Whatever it is, they’re still hiding it.

        Land purchases, everywhere. Coastal areas, remote mountains, all across the map. And who’s buying it all? Different names, but it’s all Fusang. Why does a supposed NGO need this much land? And the strangest part—the money. They’re pouring in millions, with records of funds going to shadowy groups we can’t trace. Their latest financial reports, which leaked, show millions allocated to an classified secret Project called N.I.M.? What are they hiding out there? What’s buried beneath these lands? Secrets they don’t want found. Secrets worth millions.

        So, what’s the endgame? Why hide an entire empire from us? My theory points to something ancient—Penglai, a city that supposedly vanished. But what if it didn’t? What if it was “lost” on purpose? Fusang knows what’s out there. They’re not hiding this for fun; they’re guarding something. Secrets buried in history, locked away from you and me. It’s too powerful, too dangerous for us, they say. But who gave them the right? The truth is within reach, if we look hard enough...
